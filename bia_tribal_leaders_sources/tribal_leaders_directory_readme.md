### Summary

This dataset provides contact information for Tribal leadership and point locations for Tribal office headquarters for all 587 federally recognized tribes.

It is important to note that the Tribal Leadership Directory is not an official listing of federally recognized tribes. It should be used in conjunction with the Federal Register Notice of Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs (81 Fed. Reg. 26826), which is the official listing of all federally recognized tribes in the United States, pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-454, 108 Stat. 4791-4792). Since tribal elections and other changes in tribal leadership occur throughout the year, the Directory’s information is the most currently available at the time of its most recent weekly update. Because the BIA cannot track all tribal leadership changes in real time, it does not guarantee the accuracy of the Directory’s tribal contact information.
